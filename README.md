# Studying Correlations in MoEs via HyperNetworks

## Todo

### 1. Non-ensemble

- [x] Train separate MLPs on Iris
- [x] Train hypernetwork for MLPs on Iris
- [x] See mode connectivity.
- [ ] Compute variances
- [ ] Compute mutual information

### 2. Specialization

- [x] Train separate MLPs on each feature
- [x] Train hypernetwork for MLPs on each feature
- [ ] Compute variances
- [ ] Compute mutual information
