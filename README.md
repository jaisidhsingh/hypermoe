# Studying Correlations in MoEs via HyperNetworks

## Todo

### 1. Non-ensemble

- [x] Train separate MLPs on Iris
- [ ] Train hypernetwork for MLPs on Iris
- [x] See mode connectivity.
- [ ] Compute variances
- [ ] Compute mutual information

### 2. Ensemble

- [ ] Use MLPs from (1.) in an ensemble
- [ ] Use hypernetwork from (1.) for an ensemble of MoEs
- [ ] Compute variances
- [ ] Observe loss reduction w.r.t theory
- [ ] Compute mutual information between ensembles

### 3. Specialization

- [ ] Train separate MLPs on each feature
- [ ] Train hypernetwork for MLPs on each feature
- [ ] Compute variances
- [ ] Compute mutual information
